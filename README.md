# reducing-runtime-of-EfficientNet-using-Pruning

Multi-task EfficientNet-B2 realises the current state of art in facial expression and emotion recognition, the model excecution time however restricts interactive applications of such technology.
Working with the startup Emobot we were tasked to study reducing the runtime of the model and trying to keep the most accuracy possible
using weight pruning runtime was cut by a half and accuracy dropped from 62% to 58%, tested on a sample of 4000 images of the affectnet database

here I put the 5 files that allows testing the model before and after pruning
